<blockquote>
<h3>Version 2.0 - Aug 21, 2012</h3
<p>
This major version adds support for incremental runs to avoid computing statistics on old data and an SQL format beautifier on each reported query. The CSV log parser has been entirely rewritten.
</p>
<pre>
This major version adds some changes not backward compatible with previous versions. Options
-p and -g are not more used as progress bar and graphs generation are enabled by default now.
The obsolete -l option use to specify the log file to parse has been reused to specify an
incremental file. Outside these changes and some bug fix there's also new features:

    * Using an incremental file with -l option allow to parse multiple time a single log file
      and to "seek" at the last line parsed during the previous run. Useful if you have a log
      rotation not sync with your pgbadger run. For exemple you can run somthing like this:

        pgbadger `find /var/log/postgresql/ -name "postgresql*" -mtime -7 -type f` \
            -o report_`date +%F`.html -l /var/run/pgbadger/last_run.log

    * All queries displayed in the HTML report are now clickable to display or hide a nice 
      SQL query format. This is called SQL format beautifier.

    * CSV log parser have been entirely rewritten to handle csv with multiline.

Every one should upgrade.
